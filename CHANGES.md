# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).  Though
this project doesn't really have releases (or even versioning, until now), it
is a project that effects Recursers in "real ways".  It would be nice to have a
place to quickly see the latest changes that the project has undergone.
