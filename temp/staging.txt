brief documentation of our staging environment's configuration:

instructions for configuring git locally: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/multiple-environments

it's got a copy (as of today) of the production database. if we want to update this we have to do it manually with the postgres-backups addon with heroku

it DOESN'T have humbug keys so no worries about accidents there

it has an env var STAGING which determines some things in settings.py (mostly which DB and S3 bucket to use)

it has its own S3 bucket. If you want to see your changes (of stylesheets, etc) updated, need to run 'heroku run ./manage.py collecstatic'. For some reason it can't find the env var when deploying & updating and thinks it's running locally so you have to do this manually

lmk if you have any questions or need help setting this up! :)
