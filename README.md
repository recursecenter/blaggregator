##Blog post aggregator for the Hacker School community.

Hacker Schoolers are writing awesome blog posts all over the internet. This brings them together and provides a place where alums from every batch can discuss technical news and be an amazing audience for each other.

The live site is [HERE](http://blaggregator.us). Hacker School login required.

###Add your blog
You will be prompted to add your blog when you create an account. You can also [add it later](http://blaggregator.us/add_blog).

Once your blog is added, Blaggregator will crawl it periodically for new posts.

###Contribute

Want to contribute a feature or bugfix? Blaggregator is a straightforward Django app with a simple Bootstrap frontend. It's deployed on Heroku and uses their Postgres and Scheduler add-ons.

Key files:
- home/views.py: the heart of the app. all of the views ("controllers" if you're coming from Ruby)
- blaggregator/settings.py: app settings
- home/management/commands/crawlposts.py: background crawler script
- home/feedergrabber27.py: feed parser contributed by dpb
- home/templates/home: all templates live here

Check out [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) for contribution ideas.

###Installation:

- Set up your virtual environment

- Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Install Postgres (it's easy on OSX with [postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/)) and `pip install psycopg2`. Open the app to start your database server running locally. Open a Postgres shell:

`psql`

Create your database:

`CREATE DATABASE blaggregator_dev;`

The semicolon is critical. IMPORTANT: when you are creating your admin account on the db, *don't* use the same email address as your Hacker School account or you won't be able to create a user account for yourself. Do username+root@example.com or something.

Set up initial tables:

`$ python manage.py syncdb`

and then bring them up to date with the latest South migrations:

`$ python manage.py migrate`

If you get this error:

```
OperationalError: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
Is the server running locally and accepting
connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```
then your server isn't running. Go fiddle with Postgres.app.

- Turn on debugging in your environment so you can get useful error messages:

`export DJANGO_DEBUG=True`

- Blaggregator uses oauth2 to log in users against hackerschool.com. Go to [your settings on hackerschool.com](https://www.hackerschool.com/settings), make a new app. Name it something like "blaggregator-local" and the url should be http://localhost:8000/complete/hackerschool/ (WITH trailing slash). Grab the keys and store them in your environment as SOCIAL_AUTH_HS_KEY and SOCIAL_AUTH_HS_SECRET.

- Then run a local server:

`python manage.py runserver`

You can administer your app through the [handy-dandy admin interface](http://localhost:8000/admin). To see this page, you'll need to give your user account superuser privileges:

1. go to http://localhost:8000/ and auth in through HS's oauth
2. `$ python manage.py shell` to open Django's shell and use its ORM
3. `>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User` import the User model (should you need the other models defined in `models.py`, import from `home.models`. User uses Django's built-in User model)
4. 	`>>> u = User.objects.get(first_name="Sasha")` or whatever your first name is. Grab your user object from the db.
5. 	`>>> u.is_superuser = True` make your account a superuser so you can access the admin
6. 	`>>> u.save()` Save these changes to the db.
7. 	You should now be able to access localhost:8000/admin while logged in!

This installation can be a bit fiddly but once it's set up, it's smooth sailing.
